         “This site is an interpretation of my talk from Webstock, 
         2015. It is a companion to What Screens Want, 
         a previous essay on designing natively for screens.”
    </h2>

    <h3 class="question1">
      How does the reading fit into the canon of design as a whole?
    </h3>

      <p>
        One of the main points discussed in this article is the idea of edgelessness 
        as a characteristic of the web and how this influences web design. 
        For example. <span class="bold-underline">Frank Chimero</span>introduce <span class="bold-underline">David Hockney</span> with an image-making practice, 
        precisely describing the time and space of area by overlaying images. Each small 
        piece is superimposed and assembled to be made of a whole image. For design, 
        it is made of multiple variable elements and consists of a whole.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question2">
        Do you think the reading holds up to a 
        contemporary practice of interaction design?
      </h3>

      <p>
        The reading relates reasonably to the contemporary interaction 
        design practice; first, the author proposed responsive design 
        in the article. It focuses on the importance of responsiveness 
        in web design. Creating a website or interface suitable to adapt 
        to various screen sizes and devices plays a core role in contemporary 
        interaction design. The designers could keep the utility and usability 
        of laptops, desktops, and mobile phones by adopting flexible grid systems 
        and other alternative technologies.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question3">
        If the reading is older or print-focused, 
        how do you think its ideas translate to digital?
      </h3>

      <p>
        The article inspires some critical features. There are 
        some similarities and differences between print-focused and 
        digital design. To be more specific, graphics design characteristics 
        are applied in printing and the web, such as the arrangement of layout, 
        colors, selection of typography, and visual hierarchy. On the other hand, 
        interactivity, animation, accessibility, and responsiveness are the only 
        web design requirements. I want to clarify the main points of the articles 
        and then point out abstract elements from the article for digital arrangement 
        and design. At this stage, HTML and CSS would have a far-reaching effect on digital design.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question4">
        What does the author succeed in conveying in this reading?
      </h3>

      <p>
        The web is a boundless and changeable material with natural 
        characteristics and texture. The designer should work as a 
        collaboration with it. The author discusses how the concept 
        of edgelessness as a unique web page influences web design. 
        Meanwhile, it illustrates web design pays attention to assembling 
        elements into adaptable and expressive compositions rather than 
        simply making unalterable layouts. Another point in this case 
        is it is critical to question the role of technology in daily 
        life and express a desire for efficient technology.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question5">
        What did you learn from the reading that impacted how you will approach design?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Through this article, I learned that design can be heuristically 
        thought through stacking, and this is not limited to screen size, 
        which is also one of the charms of interactive design.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using stacking, you can discover unique beauty like deconstruction. 
        Consisting of an edgeless surface of unknown proportions, multiple small, 
        independent, and variable elements combined into a readable whole. 
        This describes the visual challenge well within the interaction. 
        UI design can change things; whether it is font size, pictures, 
        and other designs, it can be expressed in a transparent, communicative, and diverse way
      </p>

      <h3 class="question6">
        What do you strongly disagree with in the reading?
      </h3>

      <p class="l1">
        The author mentioned in the article that Apple’s pursuit of cool has created an extraordinarily fragile and deliberately esoteric website. Conversely, I have the opposite opinion. 
      </p>

      <p class="l2">
        And I think Apple’s pursuit of coolness shows its pursuit of innovation to some extent. It is widely known Apple has always been famous for its high pursuit of design. This pursuit is manifested in many aspects, including hardware design, software interface design, and user experience design. 
      </p>

      <p class="l3">
        For example, the design philosophy of Apple emphasizes simplicity, purity, and sophistication. They aim to remove unnecessary elements to make the product purer and easier to use. Those design principles provide a lot of inspiration for me in the future area.
