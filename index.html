    "This site is an interpretation of my talk from Webstock,
    2015. It is a companion to What Screens Want,
    a previous essay on designing natively for screens."
  </h2>

  <h3 class="question1">
    How does the reading fit into the canon of design as a whole?
  </h3>

  <p>
    One of the main points discussed in this article is the idea of edgelessness
    as a characteristic of the web and how this influences web design.
    For example.<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/" class="bold-underline">Frank Chimero</a>
    introduce David Hockney with an image-making practice, precisely describing the time and space of area by overlaying
    images. Each small piece is superimposed and assembled to be made of a whole image. For design,
    it is made of multiple variable elements and consists of a whole.
  </p>

  <h3 class="question2">
    Do you think the reading holds up to a
    contemporary practice of interaction design?
  </h3>

  <p class="p2">
    The reading relates reasonably to the contemporary interaction
    design practice; first, the author proposed responsive design
    in the article. It focuses on the importance of responsiveness
    in web design. Creating a website or interface suitable to adapt
    to various screen sizes and devices plays a core role in contemporary
    interaction design. The designers could keep the utility and usability
    of laptops, desktops, and mobile phones by adopting flexible grid systems
    and other alternative technologies.
  </p>

  <section class="blue-section">
    <p class="centered-text">
      “Edgelessness is in the web’s structure: it’s comprised of individual pages linked together, so its structure can
      branch out forever.”
    </p>
  </section>

  <div class="blue-square"></div>
  <p class="blue-words">
    “Edgelessness applies to the screens that show the web, because they offer an infinite canvas that can scroll in any
    direction for however long.”
  </p>
  <div class="blue-square2"></div>

  <div class="blue-rectangle">
    <p class="white-text">“In November of 2013, I gave a talk called What Screens Want, where I tried to answer what it
      meant to natively design for screens.”</p>
  </div>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="i1">“I said it was something I called flux—the capacity for things to change. This could be as showy as
        animation, but also as simple and fundamental as a spreadsheet sorting itself and showing new results. You can’t
        do that on paper.”</td>

      <td class="i2">
        “So, designing for screens is managing this change over time, and expressing it in clear and communicative ways.”<br><br>
        “Now, after looking at Hockney’s work for far too long, I can add another item to the list:
        edgelessness.<strong>
          A lack of edges permeates the web at all levels.”
        </strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>


  <h3 class="question3">
    If the reading is older or print-focused,
    how do you think its ideas translate to digital?
  </h3>

  <p>
    The article inspires some critical features. There are
    some similarities and differences between print-focused and
    digital design. To be more specific, graphics design characteristics
    are applied in printing and the web, such as the arrangement of layout,
    colors, selection of typography, and visual hierarchy. On the other hand,
    interactivity, animation, accessibility, and responsiveness are the only
    web design requirements. I want to clarify the main points of the articles
    and then point out abstract elements from the article for digital arrangement
    and design. At this stage, HTML and CSS would have a far-reaching effect on digital design.

  <div class="blue-rectangle2">
    <h3 class="question4">
      What does the author succeed in conveying in this reading?
    </h3>
    <table class="custom-table">
      <tr>
        <td class="td1">The web is a boundless and changeable material with natural characteristics and texture. The
          designer should work as a collaboration with it. The author discusses how the concept of edgelessness as a
          unique web page influences web design. </td>
        <td class="td2">Meanwhile, it illustrates web design pays attention to assembling elements into adaptable and
          expressive compositions rather than simply making unalterable layouts. Another point in this case is it is
          critical to question the role of technology in daily life and express a desire for efficient technology.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p class="elements">
    “Elements get stacked like a layer cake by default, and it make sense—vertical stacks are much easier to adapt
    across all kinds of screen sizes, because you don’t have layout issues to manage with more or less space across. You
    simply keep the elements the full width. This is especially handy for design methods like mobile first, since
    narrower screens can’t necessarily hold designs where elements are beside one another. By stacking, you get greater
    consistency in a design, what ever the screen size.”

  </p>



  <div class="blue-rectangle3">
    <h3 class="question5">
      What did you learn from the reading that impacted how you will approach design?
    </h3>

    <table class="custom-table2">
      <tr>
        <td class="t1">Through this article, I learned that design can be heuristically thought through stacking, and
          this is not limited to screen size, which is also one of the charms of interactive design.By using stacking,
          could discover unique beauty.</td>
        <td class="t2">Consisting of an edgeless surface of unknown proportions, multiple small, independent, and
          variable elements combined into a readable whole. This describes the visual challenge well within the
          interaction. UI design can change things; whether it is font size, pictures, and other designs, it can be
          expressed in a transparent, communicative, and diverse way.</td>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p class="an">
    “An edgeless surface of unknown proportions comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple
    vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment.”
  </p>

  <div class="blue-rectanglel">
    <h3 class="question6">
      What do you strongly disagree with in the reading?
    </h3>

    <div class="custom-tablel">
      <p class="l1">
        The author mentioned in the article that Apple’s pursuit of cool has created an extraordinarily fragile and
        deliberately esoteric website. Conversely, I have the opposite opinion.
      </p>

      <p class="l2">
        And I think Apple’s pursuit of coolness shows its pursuit of innovation to some extent. It is widely known Apple
        has always been famous for its high pursuit of design. This pursuit is manifested in many aspects, including
        hardware design, software interface design, and user experience design.
      </p>

      <p class="l3">
        For example, the design philosophy of Apple emphasizes simplicity, purity, and sophistication. They aim to
        remove unnecessary elements to make the product purer and easier to use. Those design principles provide a lot
        of inspiration for me in the future area.
